      <!-- <h4>About On Being Brown</h4>
      <p>
        During her residency, Divya Mehra explored the CFAT archive from 1999 through 2008. During this exploration she discovered On Being Brown, a short video work by Rita Malik. This video was produced through the Centre’s Media Art Scholarship Program in 1999. The video explores notions of identity and place, specifically of young women of Indian descent having grown up and living in Nova Scotia, Canada.
        <br><br>
        After seeing this work Mehra decided that Rita’s work deserved to be highlighted as a representation of this decade.

      <h4>About Rita Malik</h4>
      <p>
        Rita Malik, born in 1967 in rural Nova Scotia of recently immigrated Indian parents, she returned to Halifax in 1999 after a decade of living in other parts of Canada and discovered a passion for artistic expression through film and video. Her main focus was on identity and place, as explored in the scholarship/training projects through Afcoop [ One minute film: Identity?] and CFAT [On Being Brown]. Her artistic ambitions were then thwarted by debilitating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Graves disease [amongst other autoimmune issues] which resulted in living the lockdown lifestyle before lockdown was cool. The better moments were spent writing a newly completed novel at the breakneck speed of 15 years/5475 days/131 400 hrs/7 884 000 minutes or 0.00012 words per second, start to unpublished finish.  She also crocheted a top hat with a cool flower while contemplating identity through a far different lens than before.
